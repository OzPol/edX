## Getting Started

This course uses the textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Rob Tibshirani. You can find a free PDF copy of the second edition at statlearning.com. The file is about 21 MB. We recommend you download it now and keep it on your computer for easy reference.

You will also need the following things installed on your computer:

Python version 3.8 or higher.
Pandas  any version that's compatible with your version of Python.
Numpy any version that's compatible with your version of Python.
If you can't install those on your computer, you can still take this course! We have a programming environment that you can use right in your browser. You will need to upgrade to the paid version of the course in order to use it.

It's important to know that in this course we sometimes intentionally repeat ourselves. No one learns a concept the first time they see it. You'll encounter the same idea in your textbook, in the video lectures, in text, and in programming assignments. Sometimes more than once! We hope this will help you learn the basics better, and to remember the key points if you take a break from the course. If you feel comfortable moving forward, it's ok to skip ahead to the next programming assignment.
