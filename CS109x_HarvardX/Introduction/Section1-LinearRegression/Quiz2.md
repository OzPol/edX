## Ice Cream and Sharks

Consider this statement:

A beach community in California has collected three months of data concerning shark attacks and ice-cream sales. A simple linear regression fit on this data shows a positive relationship between ice-cream sales and shark attacks.

**Based on the above analysis, the beach should ban sales of ice-cream to avoid an increase in shark attacks.**

What do you think?

- The above argument may seem absurd, but we should take it seriously because the data and approach are solid. Maybe ice cream does cause shark attacks.
- The above argument is reasonable. Ice cream could definitely cause shark attacks.
- The above statement is absurd. I know that ice cream does not cause shark attacks.


The statement is absurd. While the data may show a positive correlation between ice-cream sales and shark attacks, correlation does not imply causation. The increase in both ice-cream sales and shark attacks is likely due to a third variable, such as warmer weather, which leads to more people going to the beach, buying ice cream, and swimming in the ocean. Therefore, banning ice-cream sales would not prevent shark attacks, as the underlying cause is unrelated to the consumption of ice cream.





## Multilinear and Polynomial Regression

Which of the following statements concerning Multi-Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression are correct?
Select all that apply.

- Multi-Linear regression means to do linear regression multiple times to find the best fit
- Multi-Linear regression derives a linear relationship between several predictor variables and a response variable \( y \)
- Any non-linear relationship between a predictor and response variable can be accurately described using a polynomial function with a large enough degree
- The standard way to extend linear regression to non-linear settings is to replace the standard linear model with a polynomial function.


Correct Answers:
- Multi-Linear regression derives a linear relationship between several predictor variables and a response variable \( y \)
- The standard way to extend linear regression to non-linear settings is to replace the standard linear model with a polynomial function.



## Choosing your Measurements

Imagine you have a dataset that records whether a patient suffered from a heart attack, and also contains the following factors for each patient: Age, Gender, Average Blood Pressure, and Favorite Color.

Imagine that you are creating a heart-failure prediction model. Which predictors will you consider? What model type will you use?

Select the best choices from the options below.
Select all that apply.

- Use a multi-linear model with all predictors - the more the better.
- Use a multi-linear model, but only use predictors 1-3 and ignore favorite color.
- Use a linear model with only age.
- Use a polynomial model with only age.
