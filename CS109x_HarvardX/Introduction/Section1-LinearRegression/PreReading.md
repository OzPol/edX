Then scroll down and answer the questions below. You'll find a set of questions after each reading in the course. If you do the reading, the questions should be much easier to answer.

Remember that in this course we intentionally repeat ourselves. No one learns a concept the first time they see it. If you feel like you know something and you're comfortable moving forward, it's ok to skip ahead to the next programming assignment. But don't skip the programming assignments! That's how you practice, and how you get your grade.
