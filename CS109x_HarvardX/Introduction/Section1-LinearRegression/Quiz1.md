**1. Catch-All: The authors in the book call the error term "a catch-all". Which of the following is not part of the catch-all error?**
-   A mistake in the code
-   Measurement error
-   Mis-specification error. The true relationship is probably not linear.

Ref. Pg. 72

Here beta0 is the intercept term—that is, the expected value of Y when X = 0, and beta1 is the slope—the average increase in Y associated with a one-unit increase in X. The error term is a catch-all for what we miss with this simple model: the true relationship is probably not linear, there may be other variables that cause variation in Y , and there may be measurement error. We typically assume that the error term is independent of X.

Answer: A mistake in the code is not part of the Catch-all Error. 

**2. The sample mean and population means are different.**

True or False? 

True: The sample mean and the population mean are different, but in general the sample mean will provide a good estimate of the population mean.
